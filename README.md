# reagent-core-async-scroll-table
a simple scroll table made with reagent and core-async channels

## my initial reactions:

1. reagent is pretty nice, and i actually like the hiccup-style syntax a lot. that said, it does a whole lot less magic than i thought it would.

2. core.async channels are hard for me to understand and use. also, i have no idea how i would feasibly combine multiple channels' information,, or how to dedupe channel entries or anything sophisticated. i'm just an RxJS user.

3. i don't know how to write cljs/lisp. my last attempt was in jan: https://github.com/justinwoo/etch-sketch-om

4. figwheel is really cool. i especially liked seeing compilation errors come up in the browser.

5. i can't understand half the compilation errors, and googling does not really help either.
